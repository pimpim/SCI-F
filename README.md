# SCI-F
The Standard Container Integration Format is a container organizational format that aims to make container developerment and
usage easy. Our goals are centered around container **consistency**, **transparency**, **programmatic accessibility**, 
and internal **modularity**. [Read about](http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/) the standard and please [contribute](https://github.com/containers-ftw/SCI-F/issues)!

Development of this document included the following:

- Getting feedback from the community and users 
- Finalize the integration, now part of the Singularity [development branch](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/tree/development) (2.4 release)
- Create a web interface with testing and documentation for SCI-F for apps [containers-ftw.github.io/apps](https://containers-ftw.github.io/apps)
- Collect and implement real world use cases and examples for SCI-F
